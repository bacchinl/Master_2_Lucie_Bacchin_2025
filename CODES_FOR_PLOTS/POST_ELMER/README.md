* Subplot Dmin-Dmax.py to plot damage for temperature of 0 and -10 degrees from elmer output vtu

* subplot_buttressing_2.py to calculate buttressing (flow projected) over the Ice-shelf, do not work without adding a sliding law in simulation

* subplot velocities.py plot observed velocities, velocities calculated after the optimization of eta and differences (or relative difference in percent). Also generate a text file with statistic for each year.

* subplot visco.py plot effective viscosity map and generate a text file with statistics

* subplot visco area.py is a upgraded version of subplot visco that distinguish different area of the IS (shear margin, grounding line, center, west IS, east IS) for statistic analysis.
